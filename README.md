# **My First Website- Rural Tourism**
---

##Problem Statement

In this busy life it is necessary to take a break. But travelling abroad can be very expensive. Why travel abroad when our country's rural areas have so much to offer.

##Solutions provided by my website

I have designed a website that will help people to find the best rural tourism places in India. The website will have a list of places with their location and contact details. 

Moreover people from rural areas can upload about their place and give a part of their house as rent to the tourists. This leads to the development of rural areas and also helps the people to earn some money.

##Technologies Used

The website utilizes the following technologies:

<b>Django:</b> Django is a high-level Python web framework that provides the backend structure for the website. It handles the routing, data models, database integration, and business logic.

<b>React.js:</b> React.js is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of dynamic and interactive components for the frontend of the website. React.js communicates with the backend APIs to fetch data and update the UI accordingly.
